         desc: `One of the top benefits of using AI is the enhanced customer experience it enables. Artificial intelligence enables organizations to put forth enhanced product offerings through the rigorous, ongoing analysis of consumer activity. For instance, if users are regularly engaging with certain features and functions, or experiencing performance issues on certain pages, AI can help you immediately identify these issues, and even provide suggestions to resolve the problem.
         <br><br>
         Aside from analyzing customer activity, artificial intelligence can also facilitate consumer interaction. For instance, by analyzing the behavioral patterns of consumers, AI can also improve marketing efforts through personalization by offering more relevant advertisements and product recommendations. Or, you could use an AI-enabled chatbot to provide real-time support to users. When combined with machine learning technology, you can even improve your support by letting your chatbot learn from every interaction for a continually enhanced experience. `,

        desc: `One other benefit to artificial intelligence is the ability to automate business processes. Instead of spending labor hours having an employee do repetitive tasks, you can use an AI-based solution that will perform those operations instantaneously. Additionally, by leveraging machine learning capabilities, the algorithm will be able to automatically provide optimizations for business processes that are on-premise and in the cloud. For instance, a logistics company could use AI to analyze and optimize their infrastructure, workloads, communication, transportation, and more.
        <br><br>
        This results in savings in both time and money through better productivity and, oftentimes, more accurate work. Now, instead of assigning employees to do repetitive or ongoing tasks, you can use their intellectual capital to find new solutions to business problems.`,

        desc: `AI is also useful for businesses that need to constantly communicate with high volumes of customers throughout each day. For example, in the transport industry, bus, train and airlines companies, which can have millions of passengers a day, can use AI to interact, in real-time, to send personalised travel information, such as notice of delays. Some bus companies, for example, are already tracking the location of their buses and using AI to provide travellers with real-time updates about where the bus is along its route and its estimated time of arrival. Customers receive this information on the bus company's app.`,
