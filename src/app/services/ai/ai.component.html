        In the past, companies had to rely on data scientists to analyze their data and detect trends. Due to the
        enormous amount of data available and the limited time in their workday, it was nearly impossible for them to
        detect every trend or beneficial piece of information.
        <br><br>
        Now, through the use of artificial intelligence, data can be analyzed and sorted in real-time. In turn,
        organizations are able to increase the speed of optimization when it comes to business decisions, ultimately
        achieving greater outcomes at a quicker pace. These outcomes can be as small as improving internal business
        processes, to as large as improving the efficiency of traffic in large cities.
        <br><br>
        The other benefits of AI are almost limitless. Letâ€™s dive into how organizations can take advantage.
